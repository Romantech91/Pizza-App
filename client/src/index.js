import React from 'react'; 
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; 
import App from './App'; 


ReactDOM.render(

    <App /> 
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')

// In the code above, we are importing React and ReactDOM from the 'react' and 'react-dom' packages. We are also importing the App component from './App' and rendering it inside the root element in the HTML file. The App component is wrapped in the React.StrictMode component to enable additional checks and warnings for potential issues in the application. This is the main entry point for the React application and renders the App component inside the root element in the HTML file. The App component contains the main structure of the application and renders other components as needed.
